That's okay; all you really need to be able to do before using Statamechanic is navigate to the correct folder.

### How to Navigate
There's a single, simple command you need to know: `cd`. `cd` stands for change directory (another term for a folder). To use it, just type `cd` and the path to the desired folder.

#### Navigating to Your Site Folder

1. Type:

   ~~~
   cd ~/Sites/name_of_your_site_folder
   ~~~

   If you're having trouble finding the <kbd>~</kbd>, check under <kbd>esc</kbd>. It's the secondary character for the <kbd>`</kbd>. Hold <kbd>shift</kbd>, and hit that sucker.

   <i class="badge badge-info">i</i> `~` is a shortcut for your user folder.</aside>

2. Hit <kbd>return &#9166;</kbd>.

<span class="label">Alternate Method</span> If you're still having trouble, you can:

1. Type `cd`.
2. Hit <kbd>space</kbd>.
3. Drag the folder from Finder into the Terminal window.
4. Hit <kbd>return &#9166;</kbd>.

<span class="badge badge-success whale">^_______^</span> Now you've navigated to your site folder and can call the appropriate script as explained elsewhere in the docs.
