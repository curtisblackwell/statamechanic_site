title: Support

For now, support requests should be emailed to <the@statamechanic.com>. I have plans to use a forum (or something similar) in the near future, however I'm waiting to see what Statamic offers, if anything, when the marketplace launches.

<span class="badge badge-warning">!</span> Because Statamechanic isn't a typical add-on and is comprised mainly of shell scripts, only Mac OS X is officially supported and tested.

### Feature Requests
Feature requests are encouraged and should be emailed to <the@statamechanic.com>.
